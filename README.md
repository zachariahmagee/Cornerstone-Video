### Technical Challenge
Write a simple website that utilizes (wikipedia movie data)[https://github.com/prust/wikipedia-movie-data] to display a list of movies; create a filter for decade and a filter for genre. Optionally, you could add functionality for users to “like” particular movies (these “likes” can be stored client-side, server-side, or not stored). As a bonus, the website could recommend movies based on the genres and actors of “liked” films.
